     <h4>Sourdough Bread</h4>
      <>A beginner's recipe to bread-making with your own starter</p>  
        
                 
        <li>Fully mature sourdough starter</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Rye Flour</li>
        <li>Salt</>    
                 
        <>
        <li>Make your levain. Do this by combining your sourdough starter with 1/2 cup of water and 2/3 cup of bread and rye flours </li>
        <li>Let the levain mature for 5-8 hours. It should visably grow in size. </li>
        <li>Autolypse the rest of the flour and water. Mix these together by hand and then let it rest for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Mix the levain with the flour/water mixture. </li>
