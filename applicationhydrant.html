<p>Firefighters don’t have a system to locate and map fire hydrants. With no system in place, firefighters lose time locating hydrants, especially in the snow, while putting out fires. Just like 411, and parking mobile apps, Hydrant similarly embraces the intermingling of civil service and tech.</p>

<p>When using hydrant, users are brought to their current location and see the hydrants in their area. You can search for another neighborhood or destination at the top, as well as find your current GPS location. When you click on a hydrant, you get the address and coordinates of the hydrant, as well as an option to get directions to that location externally through Google Maps or Waze. To add a hydrant, you click on the add hydrant symbol, and choose whether you want to use your current location or drop a pin. You select and hold to drop a pin and then submit the pin with a required image and it’s coordinates and addresss.</p>

            
<p>Additionally, snowed in hydrants are a huge issue, so the app detects when there’s a snow storm in the area so you can update a hydrant’s status and check to see which hydrants are shoveled or not. Now when you select a hydrant, you can select the update status button  to indicate if the hydrant is shoveled or not with an image and then submit. Ultimately this app would help civilians and civil servants alike to make the community safer and prevent the spread of fire.
